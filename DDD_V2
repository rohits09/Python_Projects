Now can you develop a DDD for one of the real use case scenario in banking industry. Suppose for a XYZ bank, user wants his statements to get downloaded digitally through banking digital portal. Here user will login to bank portal, where he will be going to order the copy of his/her bank statements to his/her address. Firstly portal will prompt him/her with for the reason of why he/she needs the statements. Then post the response he will be moving to next page where he will be getting an option to select date or date ranges to select statements which he/she needs to order. Post that selection/request of the statments , new page will show where he will add order for those selected statements. Here all the statements will be fetch through an api (documents endpoint) from which user will select specific statements to order, this will be sent through api(add copy statement request endpoint). And One more api is used which will show options on page where customer will select reasons why he/she needs statements(reasons endpoint) and last api for where he needs to cancel statements request(cancel statement request endpoint). In my team mostly it's UI/Ux work and api callings to fetch details to show to user. And lastly then user will add order after final review of statements that he wants to order to his address. There is a valid address validation steps done through api.

Perfect, Yeon! Let’s build a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) model around your banking use case — “Ordering Bank Statements Digitally”.

🏦 Real Banking Scenario: DDD Design
🧩 Use Case Summary:
A bank customer logs into the portal → selects a reason → picks date range → reviews available statements → selects and orders → validates delivery address → submits the request → can cancel the request if needed.

⚙️ Step-by-Step DDD Model
🔷 1. Bounded Contexts (BC)
Let’s split this use case into meaningful Bounded Contexts:

Bounded Context	Responsibility
📄 Statement Ordering	Handles ordering flow, user input, validations
📁 Document Management	Manages fetching available statements/documents
📦 Delivery Management	Handles address validation and delivery preferences
🗳️ User Intent & Reason	Captures reason for statement request
❌ Cancellation	Handles cancel requests and revokes statement orders
Each BC can expose APIs or events, own their models, and operate independently.


🧠 2. Ubiquitous Language
Use consistent language across tech and business:

StatementOrder, DateRange, ReasonCode, StatementDocument, CustomerAddress, OrderStatus, CancelRequest, etc.


🧱 3. Core Domain Models
A. Entity: StatementOrder
class StatementOrder:
    def __init__(self, customer_id, selected_statements, delivery_address, reason_code):
        self.order_id = generate_id()
        self.customer_id = customer_id
        self.statements = selected_statements  # List[StatementDocument]
        self.reason_code = reason_code
        self.delivery_address = delivery_address
        self.status = "PENDING"
B. Value Objects
DateRange(from_date, to_date)

ReasonCode(code, description)

CustomerAddress(line1, city, pincode) – validated through API

StatementDocument(doc_id, date, type)


📡 4. Domain Services (Orchestrate flow)
✅ StatementOrderService
class StatementOrderService:
    def __init__(self, repo, document_api, address_api, reason_api):
        self.repo = repo
        self.document_api = document_api
        self.address_api = address_api
        self.reason_api = reason_api

    def fetch_reasons(self):
        return self.reason_api.get_reasons()

    def fetch_statements(self, date_range):
        return self.document_api.get_statements(date_range)

    def validate_address(self, address):
        return self.address_api.validate(address)

    def place_order(self, customer_id, statements, address, reason_code):
        if not self.validate_address(address):
            raise Exception("Invalid address")
        order = StatementOrder(customer_id, statements, address, reason_code)
        self.repo.save(order)
        return order

    def cancel_order(self, order_id):
        order = self.repo.get_by_id(order_id)
        if order.status != "DELIVERED":
            order.status = "CANCELLED"
            self.repo.save(order)


🌐 5. Application Layer Flow
Page 1:    GET /reasons → [reason list]
Page 2:    User selects reason → clicks continue

Page 3:    Select date range → GET /statements?from=...&to=...

Page 4:    Select documents from fetched list → click next

Page 5:    Show address → POST /validate-address
           If valid, continue

Page 6:    Final review → POST /place-order
Page X:    User may call → POST /cancel-order


🏗️ 6. APIs You Already Mentioned
API Endpoint	Context	Description
/reasons	Reason Context	Get available reasons
/documents	Document Management	Fetch available statements
/add-copy-statement-request	Statement Ordering	Submit order
/cancel-statement-request	Cancellation	Cancel submitted order
/validate-address	Delivery Context	Verify user address
🗃️ 7. Repository (In-Memory or DB abstraction)
class StatementOrderRepository:
    def __init__(self):
        self.orders = {}

    def save(self, order):
        self.orders[order.order_id] = order

    def get_by_id(self, order_id):
        return self.orders.get(order_id)


✅ Benefits of DDD Here
Clean separation of business logic

Easy to evolve and scale each context (e.g., different delivery modes)

Clear API boundaries for teams (your UI/UX team mostly works with frontend+API)

Strong modeling reduces bugs and improves communication
