🏦 Use Case: Digital Bank Statement Ordering
🔹 High-Level Flow:
Customer logs in

System asks reason for statement

Customer selects date range

System fetches available statements (via API)

Customer places an order for selected statements

System confirms the order (and possibly sends it to address/email)

🔷 1. Identify Bounded Contexts
We divide responsibilities into bounded contexts:

Bounded Context	Responsibilities
CustomerContext	Auth, customer data, basic identity
StatementContext	Statement metadata, fetch by date, display logic
OrderContext	Order statement copies, track delivery
ReasonContext	Manages selectable reasons for requesting copies
🧠 2. Ubiquitous Language
Term	Meaning
Statement	A digital or printable record of bank transactions
Reason	The business/legal reason for which user wants statements
Order	A user request to receive physical/digital statements
Date Range	The start and end date for statement fetching
🏗️ 3. Domain Model by Context
✳️ StatementContext
@dataclass
class StatementMetadata:
    statement_id: str
    customer_id: str
    start_date: date
    end_date: date
    delivery_type: str  # 'Digital' or 'Hard Copy'
✳️ ReasonContext
@dataclass
class StatementRequestReason:
    code: str
    description: str
These are fetched via a separate API call.
This context owns the reasons and exposes it to UI.

✳️ OrderContext
@dataclass
class StatementOrder:
    order_id: str
    customer_id: str
    statement_ids: List[str]
    reason_code: str
    delivery_address: Optional[str]
    order_status: str = "Pending"
🛠️ 4. Application Layer Flow
This is what your UI/API orchestration team mostly touches:

Frontend -> API Gateway

➡️ GET /reasons-for-statement → (ReasonContext)
➡️ POST /fetch-statements?date_from=&date_to= → (StatementContext)
➡️ POST /place-order → (OrderContext)
🔌 5. API Calls & Integration Mapping
API / Feature	Context	Purpose
/get-reasons	ReasonContext	Fetch reasons for UI dropdown
/fetch-statements	StatementContext	Retrieve metadata from core DB/API
/create-order	OrderContext	Record and initiate delivery of order
📐 6. UI Layer Sequence (High-Level)
Step 1 → Login ✅
Step 2 → Call /get-reasons → show dropdown
Step 3 → User selects date range → call /fetch-statements
Step 4 → Show available statements with checkboxes
Step 5 → User selects statements + reason → submit form
Step 6 → Call /create-order with reason + statement IDs
Step 7 → Show order confirmation
🧩 7. Optional Enhancements
Feature	Add To Context
PDF generation	StatementContext or Shared Service
Notifications (SMS/email)	NotificationContext
Audit trail for requests	AuditContext
✅ 8. Summary: How DDD Helps Here
Separation of responsibility → No mixed logic in API or UI.

Team autonomy → UI team works with clean APIs per context.

Scalability → Order and Statement APIs evolve independently.

Clarity → Everyone (even non-tech folks) uses the same vocabulary.
